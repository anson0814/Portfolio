    <h1>About the Project</h1>
    <p>
      For the final project in my Digital Games Programming class, I designed and developed a Roguelike game titled
      "Dungeon Explorer". In addition to programming the game, I also made all the assets within the game from the
      environment to the characters. To keep it engaging, I also applied game design principles such as increasing
      difficulty as you progress.

    <p>
      Tools Used: Illustrator, Processing
    </p>

    <h2>The Process</h2>
    <p>
      Being an open-ended project, I considered various other game genres ranging from simulators to puzzle games before
      I ended up with my final option being a Roguelike. Before coding, I conceptualized the progression game to ensure
      the players stay engaged while they advance through the game. I focused on three out of the eight types of fun in
      games being narrative, challenge, and discovery to keep my game enjoyable for users. I then created a couple story
      boards to visualize how the characters and map might look in the end. The last step I took before coding was
      creating a UML diagram to better organize how my file structure might look like in its implementation.
    </p>

    <h2>The Game</h2>
    <p>
      I coded this game using Processing, and it requires a player to interact with a mouse and keyboard to play. In
      addition to this, the game also features hit detection between various moving objects, a health system, and
      different rooms to progress through. Using a finite-state machine model, I created a multi-stage game.
    </p>

    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      Designing and coding a game from scratch taught me a lot about the difficulties of game development. Through
      completion of this project, I refined my game designing skill alongside adding to my coding and object-oriented
      programming experience.
