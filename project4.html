        <!-- Project Background -->
        <p>
            For my Interaction Design Class, our task was to collaborate with a participant group (such as a restaurant, charity, shop, etc.) and design a technological solution addressing an interaction design problem within a 13-week timeframe. We had the opportunity to work with Big Way Hot Pot, facilitated by one of our group members' connections with the kitchen manager.
        </p>

        <p>
            To tackle this task, we employed the double diamond design approach, consisting of discovery, definition, development, and delivery phases. This structured methodology provided a clear and systematic design thinking path, enhancing our ability to address the complexities of the project.
        </p>

        <!-- Discovery Phase -->
        <h2 class="text-center">Discovery Phase</h2>
        <p>
            After conducting preliminary research on the restaurant, we initiated our ethnography by interviewing the kitchen manager, our contact at Big Way Hot Pot. Additionally, we briefly engaged with a few customers to identify their pain points. The key findings from this phase included:
        </p>
        <div class="project-list">
        <ul>
            <li>Queue times can get quite long, especially during peak hours, and customers may not know when they can proceed to the selection of ingredients.</li>
            <li>Newer customers struggle with ingredient and soup combinations.</li>
            <li>Customers are unaware of the price of their pot until checkout.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <!-- User Personas and Journey Map -->
        <h4 class="text-center">User Personas and Journey Map</h4>
        <p>
            Based on the ethnography data, we created two user personas along with their journey maps to conceptualize potential interaction pain points and identify locations for technology implementation.
        </p>

        <!-- Definition Phase -->
        <h2 class="text-center">Definition Phase</h2>
        <p>
            We began the definition phase by creating three concepts addressing identified interaction problems. After feedback and group reflection, our reframed design focus was to enhance the overall dining experience by providing ingredients guidance to customers unfamiliar with Big Way's special hotpot. The participatory workshop with the Big Way team was conducted to uncover user frustrations, explore design ideas, and generate design opportunities.
        </p>

        <!-- Workshop Findings -->
        <h4 class="text-center">Workshop Findings:</h4>
        <div class="project-list">
        <ul>
            <li>Detailed menu information can help customers make informed choices.</li>
            <li>Pre-set combos can be helpful for newer customers.</li>
            <li>A digital cart interface can help save customersâ€™ selections.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <!-- Development Phase -->
        <h2 class="text-center">Development Phase</h2>
        <p>
            From the workshop findings, we refined our design focus and created two design concepts and detailed storyboards. Our final concept, PotBot, emerged as a solution to address the challenges faced by new users. This AI-powered system allows customers to enter keywords and generate custom bowls, providing a user-friendly experience without interfering with Big Way's unique self-serving hot pot system.
        </p>

        <!-- Delivery Phase -->
        <h2 class="text-center">Delivery Phase</h2>
        <p>
            The final concept, PotBot, enhances the overall dining experience at Big Way Hot Pot. Customers can confidently and swiftly pick their desired ingredients, and the AI-powered combination builder streamlines the decision-making process for an enjoyable and personalized hot pot experience.

            <!-- Outcome -->
            <h2 class="text-center">Outcome</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout this 13-week design experience, I gained valuable insights and knowledge, even though the final design may not have been implemented or used. The application of the double diamond design methodology was particularly beneficial, providing a structured path for design thinking. I am grateful for the opportunity to utilize this framework, as it not only enhanced my understanding of the design process but also allowed for meaningful learning and growth.
